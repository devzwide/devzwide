# Bukeka Nxumalo, your aspiring Cloud Engineer

Hi, I'm Bukeka Nxumalo, a passionate and driven ICT student at Durban University of Technology. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree and gaining hands-on experience in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) through academic projects and collaborative work.

During my studies, I've contributed to web and mobile application projects as part of 10-member teams. These projects helped me build strong technical and communication skills while working with real-world tools and frameworks.

My ultimate goal is to become a Software Engineer and grow into a career in Cloud Engineering.
